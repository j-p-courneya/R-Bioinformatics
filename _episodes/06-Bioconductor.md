## R Packages and CRAN

It is possible to add functions to R by writing a package, or by
obtaining a package written by someone else. As of this writing, there
are over [17,000 packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/) available on CRAN (the comprehensive R archive
network). R and RStudio provide functionality for managing packages:

### From the console:

* You can see what packages are installed by typing
  `installed.packages()`
* You can install packages by typing `install.packages("packagename")`,
  where `packagename` is the package name, in quotes.
* You can update installed packages by typing `update.packages()`
* You can remove a package with `remove.packages("packagename")`
* You can make a package available for use with `library(packagename)`

### Using the RStudio interface

You can also use the RStudio interface to view and install packages. `Pane 4` (which might be different for you if you've personalized RStudio's interface) provides a `Packages` tab that allows you to see the packages you have installed in your `User Library`, these are the packages you have installed throughout your R use experience, and also the `System Library` the packages that are part of the R kernal which is updated when you update your version of R.  

The default packages interface for RStudio:
