## R Packages and CRAN

It is possible to add functions to R by writing a package, or by
obtaining a package written by someone else. One of the primary ways in which packages are distributed is through centralized repositories. The first R repository a user typically runs into is the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) (CRAN), As of this writing, there are over [17,000 packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/) available on CRAN, the home of many of the most popular R packages. R and RStudio provide functionality for managing packages:

### From the console:

* You can see what packages are installed by typing
  `installed.packages()`
* You can install packages by typing `install.packages("packagename")`,
  where `packagename` is the package name, in quotes.
* You can update installed packages by typing `update.packages()`
* You can remove a package with `remove.packages("packagename")`
* You can make a package available for use with `library(packagename)`

### Using the RStudio interface

You can also use the RStudio interface to view and install packages. `Pane 4` (which might be different for you if you've personalized RStudio's interface) provides a `Packages` tab that allows you to see the packages you have installed and loaded at a given point in time. The `Packages` tab is broken down into your `User Library`, these are the packages you have installed throughout your R use experience, and also the `System Library` the packages that are part of the R kernel which is updated when you update your version of R.  

The default packages interface for RStudio: 
```{r echo=F, out.width = '60%', fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("../fig/rstudio_packages.png")
```

To install a package click <KBD>Install</KBD> and type the package name of interest in the popup window. 

```{r echo=F, out.width = '30%', fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("../fig/rstudio_installpkg_button.png")
```

```{r echo=F, out.width = '30%', fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("../fig/rstudio_installpkg_popout.png")
```

### Loading Packages

When it comes time to load a package you have installed it can also be done a number of ways most commonly it will be done using the console or writing it at the beginning of a script since the first thing you should be doing in your script is loading libraries. 

**From the console:**
```{r loadLib, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
library(<package>)
```

**Using the RStudio interface:** 
```{r echo=F, out.width = '60%', fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("../fig/rstudio_loadLib.png")
```
Click the white box next to a package in your library and that will load the library in to your session. 

> ## Tip: Beware of loading conflicts
>Pay attention to the messages that are being printed to the console when you load a package. Sometimes you will see `The following objects are masked from...`. This is telling you that when the package is loaded the function that typically is related to another package is now being referenced by the package you loaded. 
>Sometimes this can cause a conflict between other packages which depend on the native function being masked and cause your code to break. Beware!

## About Biocondutor

Similar to CRAN, [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) is a repository of R packages as well. Bioconductor provides tools for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. Bioconductor uses the R statistical programming language, and is open source and open development. It has two releases each year, and an active user community. 

### Installing Bioconductor 

In order to install Bioconductor packages you first need the BiocManager package which is hosted on CRAN. To install it you will need to run: 
```{r installBiocManager, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
install.packages("BiocManager")
```

## Bioconductor releases and current version

The Bioconductor project produces two releases each year, one around April and another one around October.

The April release of Bioconductor coincides with the annual release of R.
Packages in that Bioconductor release are tested for the upcoming version of R.
Users must install the new version of R to access the new version of those packages.

The October release of Bioconductor continue to work with the same version of R for that annual cycle.

Each time a new release is made, the minor version of all the packages in the Bioconductor repository is incremented by one.

Once the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("BiocManager")` package is installed, the `BiocManager::version()` function displays the version (i.e., release) of the Bioconductor project that is currently active in the R session.

```{r, message=FALSE}
BiocManager::version()
```

> ## Release cycle - release and devel branches
>
> ### Release branches
>
> Bioconductor uses the [Git]([https://github.com/]) version control system to manage its package repository.
> For each new Bioconductor release, a new branch is created in the Git repository; those are referred to as _release_ branches.
> Release branches allow users to install stable versions of packages that were tested together for a given version of Bioconductor.
>
> Development on the _release_ branches is restricted.
> Older _release_ branches are entirely frozen, meaning that no further update is allowed on those branches.
> When users request a package for a given version of Bioconductor, they receive the latest version of the package on the correspoding release branch.
> 
> Only the latest release branch allows updates from package maintainers, but those are restricted to critical bug fixes.
> This means that for each 6-month release cycle, users can expect packages on the latest branch to be reasonably stable.
>
> ### Devel branches
>
> Meanwhile, the main branch of the Git repository (historically called `master`) is referred to as the _devel_ branch.
>
> The _devel_ branch allow developers to continue updating the packages as frequently as they wish, without affecting users or disrupting workflows.
> Typically, packages on the _devel_ branch are mainly used by other developers and the Bioconductor build system, to run tests using the latest code of every package in the Bioconductor repository.
> However, users can also access packages on the _devel_ branch using `BiocManager::install(version = ...)` with `version` set to one minor version greater than the latest Bioconductor _release_ version (e.g. if the latest release is `3.13`, then devel is `3.14`).
>
> ### Transition between devel and release - the release process
>
> After a new release branch is created, the minor version of every single package on the _devel_ branch is incremented by one.
> This includes the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("BiocVersion")` package, which marks the value of the next version of Bioconductor.

## Installing Bioconductor packages

The `BiocManager::install()` function is used to install packages.
The function first searches for the requested package(s) on the Bioconductor repository, but falls back on the CRAN repository and also supports installation from GitHub repositories. There is a lengthy explanation by Bioconductor maintainers as to why using this is prefered over `install.packages()`. Find that [here](https://bioconductor.org/install/#why-biocmanagerinstall)

We can install the `BiocPkgTools` package which provides a collection of simple tools for learning about Bioc Packages we'd install it as so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install("BiocPkgTools")
```


# Explore the package universe

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(BiocPkgTools) #loads BiocPkgTools 
```

## Check for updates

The `BiocManager::valid()` function checks the version of currently installed packages, and checks whether a new version is available for any of them on the Bioconductor repository.

Conveniently, if any package can be updated, the function generates and displays the command needed to update those packages.
Users simply need to copy-paste and run that command in their R console.

If everything is up-to-date, the function will simply print `TRUE`.

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
BiocManager::valid()
```

## Bioconductor Help

Bioconductor stands apart from CRAN in that it requires packages to have documentation available and workflows. Bioconductor also provides a Bioconductor specific [support site](https://support.bioconductor.org/) that is a Stack Overflow type experience. The site is possible due to the contribution of developers in the Bioconductor community as well as countless dedicated volunteers answering questions. 

## Bioconductor Packages

Each package hosted on Bioconductor has a dedicated page with various resources. For an example, looking at the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scater")` package page on Bioconductor, we see that it contains:

- a brief description of the package at the top, in addition to the authors, maintainer, and an associated citation

- installation instructions that can be cut and paste into your R console
- documentation - vignettes, reference manual, news

You can gain the most traction using a package by looking at its  documentation section. Each Bioconductor package contains at least one vignette, a document that provides a task-oriented description of package functionality. Vignettes contain executable examples and are intended to be used interactively.

The reference manual contains a comprehensive listing of all the functions available in the package. This is a compilation of each function’s manual, aka help pages, which can be accessed programmatically in the R console via ?<function>.

Finally, the NEWS file contains notes from the authors which highlight changes across different versions of the package. This is a great way of tracking changes, especially functions that are added, removed, or deprecated, in order to keep your scripts current with new versions of dependent packages.

Below this, the Details section covers finer nuances of the package, mostly relating to its relationship to other packages:

upstream dependencies (Depends, Imports, Suggests fields): packages that are imported upon loading the given package
downstream dependencies (Depends On Me, Imports Me, Suggests Me): packages that import the given package when loaded
For example, we can see that an entry called simpleSingle in the Depends On Me field on the scater page takes us to a step-by-step workflow for low-level analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data.

One additional Details entry, the biocViews, is helpful for looking at how the authors annotate their package. For example, for the scater package, we see that it is associated with DataImport, DimensionReduction, GeneExpression, RNASeq, and SingleCell, to name but some of its many annotations. We cover biocViews in more detail.
